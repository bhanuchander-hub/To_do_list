# To_do_list
Todoist allows you to create and manage tasks from a simple to-do list interface
User-Friendly Interface: The code uses a simple text-based interface, which is easy for users to understand and interact with. However, depending on the target audience or use case, you might consider adding more features or enhancing the interface further.

To-Do List Representation: Using a Python list to represent the To-Do List is a straightforward approach. Consider adding more details to tasks, such as due dates or priority levels, if you want to expand the functionality.

Input Validation: The implementation includes input validation to handle cases where users provide invalid input. This is crucial for maintaining a robust and error-free application.

Reusability of Functions: Each function (display_menu(), view_todo_list(), add_task(), mark_completed(), delete_task()) has a specific responsibility, promoting code modularity and reusability. This makes the code maintainable and easy to extend.

Continuous User Interaction: The main() function is structured with a loop to continuously prompt the user for actions until they choose to exit. This ensures a seamless and persistent user experience.

Potential Improvements:

Consider adding error messages or prompts for better user guidance.
Enhance the To-Do List features, such as sorting tasks, searching for specific tasks, or categorizing tasks.
Implement file I/O to save and load the To-Do List, providing persistence across program executions.
Add more user customization options, like changing the display format or setting reminders.
Overall, the described code provides a solid foundation for a To-Do List application, and you can further enhance its functionality based on your specific requirements and user needs.
